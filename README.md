# 100 Days of Python 🐍

## About
This repository documents my **100 Days of Python** learning journey based on the *Complete Professional Python Bootcamp* syllabus by Angela Yu.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python and gradually apply it to **data analysis,financial analytics and automation, APIs, and real-world projects**.

Each day contains code, notes, and small exercises or mini-projects.

## What I’m Learning
- Python fundamentals
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and error handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling and CSVs
- Data analysis with Pandas & NumPy
- Data visualization
- APIs and web scraping
- Automation and simple web apps
- Applied projects and portfolio work
