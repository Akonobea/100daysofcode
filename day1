# Day 1: Strings, Input and Output in Python

# Printing a simple string
print("Hello World!")

# Printing multiple lines using the newline character (\n)
print("Hello world!\nHello world!")

# String concatenation using the + operator
print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")

# Taking user input and concatenating it with a string
print("Hello " + input("What is your name? ") + "!")

# Getting user input and storing it in a variable
username = input("What is your name? ")

# Using the len() function to find the length of the string
length = len(username)

# Printing the length of the user's name
print(length)

# Mini Project: Band Name Generator

# Ask for user's name
name = input("What is your name?\n")
print("Hello " + name + ", welcome to the Band Name Generator!")

# Ask for the city the user grew up in
hometown = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

# Ask for the user's pet name
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

# Combine pet name and hometown to create a band name
band_name = pet + " " + hometown

# Display the generated band name
print("Your band name is:", band_name)
