# Day 1 – Strings, Input & Output

## What I Learned
- How to print text to the console using `print()`
- How to work with strings in Python
- String concatenation using the `+` operator
- Using the newline character (`\n`) to print on multiple lines
- How to collect user input with `input()`
- Storing input in variables
- Using the `len()` function to get the length of a string

---

## Key Concepts
- **Strings** are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes
- **Concatenation** joins strings together
- `input()` always returns a string
- `len()` counts the number of characters in a string

## Mini Project: Band Name Generator
I built a simple program that:
1. Asks the user for their name
2. Asks for their hometown
3. Asks for their pet’s name
4. Combines the inputs to generate a band name

This helped me practice:
- Input and output
- Variables
- String concatenation

## Key Takeaway
Python programs become more interactive when user input is combined with strings and variables.
